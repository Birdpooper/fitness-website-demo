            <h3>Personal trainer and olympic weightlifting coah</h3>
            <p>Having played sports for half my life, I suffered multiple injuries to which I had no answers or
                solutions to get back
                to the game other than taking rest. This is when a wise man introduced me to the gym, his words ” get
                strong here and
                showcase it on the field”.

                Over the years I began going through numerous forms of training methods which made me lean towards
                strength sports. I
                began with the powerlifting methods and later on switched to Olympic lifting. It gave me a greater
                insight into
                biomechanics, exercise physiology, and a surface level of pain science.

                At this point in time, I would say my strength is that I can manifest the physical potential of an
                individual and
                inculcate the habit of training throughout their life. </p>

            <h3>Strength and conditioning coach</h3>
            <p>I started my journey as a sports person in 2011 ( Having played sports for 8 years ) and at that time I
                had a lot of
                questions I had in my mind about my sports journey. One thing I have experienced about the importance of
                the right coach
                and the right direction with the right knowledge.

                Working as a personal trainer since 2019.

                I do believe in making a transformative impact on lifestyles with the best workout formats that are
                innovative,
                exciting, and engaging and constantly strive towards continuously improving and exceeding the experience

                to our clients. With knowledge and well experience to give the right fitness training and valuable
                advice.

                This means going out of the way, pushing ourselves beyond our comfort zone, and being patient and open
                to feedback.

                Our mind and body are our most unique assets and there is no limit to what our mind and body can become.
                While we work
